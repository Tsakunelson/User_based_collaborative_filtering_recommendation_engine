# User_based_collaborative_filtering__recommendation_engine
## Instalation
Anaconda environment
Jupyter notebood
Python 3.6
## Motivation
We provide a Recommendation engine based on collaborative filtering by adopting three main steps :

1. Remove movies our user has already seen.
2. Find ratings of the neighbors that are highly related
3. Recommend movies to each user where both 1 and 2 above hold

We implement the three-step process above to make recommendations for every user in the movie tweetings dataset. We go through the process of implementing for individual pairs of users, which could as well be extended via looping to all users.
